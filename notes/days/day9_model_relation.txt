There are three types of model relation:
1. One-Many Relation
2. One-One Relation
3. Many-Many Relation


1. One-Many Relation  #1hour
    If you have to group a group of items under a same roof then you can use One-Many relationship.
    For example, MenuCategory and MenuItems, Students under a same Classroom, Participants under a same chatroom(chat garda)

        menu ma design garda k k topic hunchh
        eg:
        class Category:  #MenuCategory
            title

        class Food: #MenuItems
            price
            size
            caategory = models.ForeignKey(Category)
            # yasma price size ra kun category ko ho bhaner aauchh

            food.objects.all().category=apitazer
        eg:
        Students under a same Classroom
    Student table ra classroom table hunchh. tyo students classroom bhanne field ma chhutyaune ho. euta student kun class rom chh bhaner
            Student.objects.filter(classroom=1) # class room 1 ko sabai student aauxx

2. One-One Relation
    If you have to maintain a unique relationship between two tables then you can user One-One Relationship.
    For example, user and user profile, Country and Prime Minister etc.

3. Many-Many Relation
    If you have to link multiple objects of a table with multiple objects of another table then you can use
    Many-Many relationship. For example: User and User Role.

        group==>admin==>create==>mannual user

models.py
class ClassRoom(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=10)

class Student(models.Model):  # class name later becomes the table name in the database. appname_classname
    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    address = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=20)
    classroom = models.ForeignKey(ClassRoom, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="classroom_students")

classroom ra student table
student table ma classroom ko link gareko chh(multiple students sang)
-------------
on_delete=models.CASCADE means==>
classroom delete huda student ma bhayeko student pani delete hunchh
----------
related_name="classroom_students
reverse relation ko lagi use hunchh
