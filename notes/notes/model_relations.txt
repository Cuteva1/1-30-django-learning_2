There are three types of model relation:
1. One-Many Relation
2. One-One Relation
3. Many-Many Relation

1. One-Many Relation #55 min

    If you have to group a group of items under a same roof then you can use One-Many relationship.
    For example, MenuCategory and MenuItems, Students under a same Classroom, Participants under a same chatroom

    Commend:
    Student.objects.create(name="Jon", age=20, classroom=<obj>
    Student.objects.create(name="Jon", age=20, ,classroom_id=1)  #36 min

    Student.objects.filter(id=1).update(classroom_id=2)

    student= Student.objects.get(id=1)
    student.classroom_id
    student.save()
    student.classroom.name

#releted_name
    classroom=ClassRoom.objects.get(id=1)
    classroom
    students= classroom.classroom_students.all()
    students

2. One-One Relation
    If you have to maintain a unique relationship between two tables then you can user One-One Relationship.
    For example, user and user profile, Country and Prime Minister etc.

     from myapp.models import ClassRoom, Student, StudentProfile

3. Many-Many Relation
    If you have to link multiple objects of a table with multiple objects of another table then you can use
    Many-Many relationship. For example: User and User Role.
